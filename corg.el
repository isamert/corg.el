;;; Commentary:

;; *corg.el* (as in *C*omplete *ORG*) is an Emacs package that
;; provides completion-at-point for Org-mode source block and dynamic
;; block headers.  /corg/ auto-completes programming language names,
;; their parameters, and possible parameter values for source blocks.
;; For dynamic blocks, it completes block names, their parameters, and
;; possible parameter values.

  "Return a list of possible completion candidates and their types.
A single completion is in the form of

  (completion . \\='(:doc \"documentation for the completion\"
                  :ann \"annotation for the completion\"
                  :type \"type of the completion\"))

where `:doc' can be function that returns a string.

This function is used by `corg-completion-at-point'.

Generally speaking, returned completions are annotated with one of these:

- doc: Meaning that this completion is extracted from the parsing
       of documentation of executer function of the block.  There
       might be some false-positives but it's generally a trusted
       source.

- source: Meaning that this completion is extracted from the
          parsing of executer function's source code of the
          block. There might be some false-positives but it's
          generally a trusted source.

- common: Meaning that this completion is extracted from the
          `org-babel-common-header-args-w-values'.  All of the
          common variables are not implemented by all source
          blocks.  The user should be aware of that.

- native: Meaning that this completion is extracted from a
          variable similar to the common variable but it is
          specifically defined for the block which means this is
          a definitely implemented, trusted completion."
